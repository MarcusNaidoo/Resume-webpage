    <!-- The following is a description of one of my coding projects with a link to the code in my Github repository-->
    <h3> Coding Experience</h3>
                 <p> Task manager - This is a Python program that I developed as one of my projects when I was studying <br>
                     software engineering. This program was design to help a small business manage its tasks which have been<br>
                     assigned to each member in their team.<br>
                     <br>
                     The program allows users to register new users, view and add tasks, as well as view statistics.<br>
                     The current users for the task manager system are read from a task file, and it will be used for<br>
                     the logging in section of the program. The current tasks for the business are read from a text file<br>
                     as well, this will be used for generating statistics and allow the user to view current projects.<br>
                     The user is given the option to add new tasks, when the necessary data is entered by the user. The <br>
                     task is added to the text file. The link to the program file is below:<br>

                 <br>
                 <p> Inventory - This is a Python program that I developed as one of my projects when I was studying <br>
                     software engineering. This program was design to assist a store manager during stock taking sessions<br>
                     so that they can get an overview of what each stocking taking session entailed.<br>
                     <br>
                     The program allows store managers to do the following: Search products by code, Determine the product<br>
                     with the lowest quantity and restock it, Determine the product with the highest quantity, and Calculate<br>
                     the value of each item entry, based on the quantity and cost of the item. The link to the code is below:<br>

                 <br>
                 <p> Project Management System - This is a Java program design to assist Poise, a structural engineering company,<br>
                     with managing and keeping track of their projects. This program makes use of classes and it has 3 classes,<br>
                     which are:<br>
                 </p>
                 <ul>
                     <li> projectManagementSystem class - which contains the main method</li>
                     <li> project class - which has the attributes for constructing a project object. This class is linked<br>
                          to the person class (below) as some of the attributes in this class are needed from the person<br>
                          class for creating a project object.</li>
                     <li> person class - which has the attributes for constructing a person object</li>
                 </ul>
